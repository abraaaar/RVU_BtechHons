            <h1>FreshPatch - Revolutionizing Fruit Labeling</h1>
            <p>
              FreshPatch is not just any ordinary fruit sticker - it is a
              masterpiece of design and technology. With its high-quality,
              breathable, and moisture-resistant materials, it creates a unique
              microclimate around your fruits, effectively limiting the amount
              of oxygen that reaches them. This results in a remarkable increase
              in the shelf-life of your fruits, ensuring that they stay fresh
              and juicy for much longer.

          <h2>Statistics of Fruit Wastage</h2>
          <p>In the India alone, from farm to fridge, 30% - 40% of fresh fruits and vegetables go to waste. That's an annual loss in the hundreds of billions of Indian Rupee. It's time for StixFresh, the all-natural way to safely and easily extend the shelf life of fruit by up to 14 days.</p>

          <h2>How does FreshPatch even work?</h2>
          <p>
            The FreshPatch sticker's all-natural coating, made up of specially
            sourced wax and other natural ingredients, creates a protective
            layer around your fruit. We have shown that by slowing down the
            ripening process, FreshPatch can extend the freshness of many fruits
            by up to 14 days. These same studies show that fruits treated with
            the FreshPatch sticker have increased sweetness, higher retention of
            moisture, as well as sustained cellular structure resulting in
            increased firmness.
          </p>

          <h2>Does FreshPatch work on all fruit?</h2>
          <p>
            FreshPatch has been tested to work on apples, pears, avocados, dragon
            fruits, kiwis, mangoes, oranges and other citrus goodies. And we're
            always working towards adding to the list. We hope you'll experiment
            with FreshPatch stickers in your home and let us know what you find
            out!
          </p>

          <h2>Is FreshPatch safe? Any harmful ingredients on the sticker?</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is to always use all-natural, chemical-free, totally
            safe ingredients to keep your fruit fresh longer. Rest assured, the
            ingredients used in FreshPatch meet GRAS (Generally Recognized as
            Safe) requirements in accordance with the FDA.
          </p>

          <h2>When does the sticker get applied?</h2>
          <p>
            One of the many benefits of FreshPatch stickers is that they can be
            applied anywhere along the post-harvest process — packaging,
            shipping, distribution, retail, and even in your own kitchen.
          </p>

          <h2>When should I take the sticker off?</h2>
          <p>
            We recommend keeping the sticker on your fruit until just before
            you're ready to eat it.
          </p>

          <h2>Should I purchase produce ripe or still green?</h2>
          <p>
            Our studies have shown it's best to apply FreshPatch stickers when
            the fruit is green, or at least early in its ripening stage.
          </p>

          <h2>How much longer will my produce last?</h2>
          <p>
            With FreshPatch stickers, we expect your fruit's shelf life to be
            extended by 2 to 4 times longer.
          </p>

          <h2>Does fruit ripen with the sticker on?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, fruit continues to ripen while the sticker is on it. Our
            studies have shown that the natural ingredients in FreshPatch inhibit
            bacterial growth, slowing down spoilage and over-ripening.
          </p>

          <h2>Can I reuse the sticker?</h2>
          <p>
            We do not recommend re-using the sticker. Once the sticker has been
            removed it may not stick to your next piece of fruit. It's best to
            apply a fresh new sticker to each new piece of fruit.
          </p>

          <h2>How long will the formulation last on the sticker?</h2>
          <p>
            In our industry, this is referred to as “shelf life”. Initial
            studies have shown that once the sticker is removed from its
            packaging, it could last up to several weeks. We are conducting
            additional testing to achieve better data around the shelf life of
            the stickers. We're also working to optimize the formulation for
            increased shelf life.
          </p>

          <h2>I just ate part of the sticker… should I be worried?</h2>
          <p>
            No worries at all. FreshPatch is made of all-natural ingredients
            which meet GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) requirements in
            accordance with the FDA. You'll be just fine.
